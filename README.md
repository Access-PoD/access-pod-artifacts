# Access PoD — Volume 2 Artifact Pack (Version A)

**Document ID:** APOD-TR-002  
**Status:** Public Review Draft (Standards Exploration)  
This repository hosts the **canonical Version A artifact pack** referenced by the Volume 2 Public Review Draft.
**Scope:** Version A — model-agnostic, execution-independent governance artifacts supporting the Volume 2 paper.

This repository contains machine-readable artifacts supporting:
- Simulation AI-Powered Policies (SAPP)
- Access Policy-on-Demand (PoD) runtime governance
- Compliance Star Certificate (CSC) schema and scoring support files

These artifacts are provided for:
- standards exploration and technical review,
- research and comparative analysis,
- implementation study and interoperability discussion.

They are **not** a certification program and do **not** constitute regulatory guidance or legal advice.

## Folder Structure

- `schemas/`  
  JSON Schemas used to validate certificates and catalogs.
- `catalogs/`  
  Metric catalogs used by CSC scoring and telemetry mapping.
- `profiles/`  
  Sector weighting profiles and gate thresholds.
- `examples/`  
  Example certificates and sample artifacts for integration testing.
- `docs/`  
  Supporting PDF documentation and instructions.
- `_future_extensions/`  
  Reserved for Version B (architecture-specific extensions, e.g., Q-Pathformer + UGCCMT).

## Included Artifacts (Version A)

- CSC certificate schema (`csc-certificate.schema.json`)
- CSC metric catalog schema (`csc_metric_catalog_schema.json`)
- CSC metric catalog (`csc_metric_catalog_v1.json`)
- CSC sector profiles (`csc_sector_profiles_v1.json`)
- Example CSC certificate (`example_csc_certificate.json`)
- Access PoD JSON Instructions PDF (`docs/Access_PoD_JSON_Instructions_v1.pdf`)
- Pack manifest (`manifest.json`) — includes checksums when populated

## Integrity and Versioning

Releases include a manifest file (`manifest_v1a.json`) that enumerates all normative artifacts and their associated SHA-256 checksums. Integrity verification must be performed against the individual files and hashes listed in the manifest.

The v1a release is anchored to a tagged commit. Subsequent commits on the `main` branch are non-normative and are intended for clarification, documentation improvements, or preparation for future revisions (e.g., v1b). Normative scope for v1a is defined exclusively by the manifest.

Do not change the meaning of an existing `metric_id`. If a change in semantics is required, deprecate the existing identifier and introduce a new `metric_id`.

Version A artifacts are intended to remain stable for the duration of the public review cycle. Version B and later revisions should extend functionality via the `_future_extensions/` directory without modifying Version A artifacts.

GitHub-generated source archives (ZIP / TAR.GZ) are provided for convenience only and are not normative. They must not be relied upon for validation or integrity checking.
