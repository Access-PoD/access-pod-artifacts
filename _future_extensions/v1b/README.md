Access PoD — Future Extensions
Volume 2, Version B (v1b)
Architecture-Specific Governance Artifacts

Extension identifier: APOD-TR-003 — v1b
Status: Public Review Draft (Standards Exploration)
Relationship: Additive extension to Volume 2, Version A
Initiative: Policy of Developments — Access PoD

1. Purpose of this folder

This folder contains Version B (v1b) future extension artifacts for the Access PoD governance framework.

Note on Version B paper status:
The Version B paper (Second Edition — Architecture-Specific Extension) is under active review and is not yet publicly released at the time of this artifact publication.

This v1b release contains artifacts only, published to support early standards, regulatory, and architectural review. The Version B paper will be released separately once finalized.

Version B provides an architecture-specific instantiation of the model-agnostic governance framework defined in Volume 2, Version A, using Q-Pathformer as a reference execution substrate.

This folder exists to ensure that:

Version A artifacts remain stable and authoritative

Extensions can be reviewed, evolved, and iterated without modifying the baseline

Standards bodies and regulators can evaluate execution-level feasibility without conflating authority

Nothing in this folder redefines governance semantics, assurance scoring, or conformance rules defined in Version A.

2. What Version B is (and is not)
What Version B is

Version B is:

an illustrative, architecture-specific extension

a demonstration of how governance attaches at execution boundaries

a proof that continuous, revocable assurance can operate at runtime

a structured artifact set for standards and regulatory review

What Version B is not

Version B is not:

a certification scheme

a conformity assessment

a compliance declaration

a mandatory architecture

a security or cryptography specification

an onboarding or deployment guide

Adoption or non-adoption of Version B artifacts does not affect conformance to Version A.

3. Folder structure and authority model

The v1b extension is intentionally structured to separate authority, interpretation, and operational guidance.

_future_extensions/
  v1b/
    README.md
    manifest_v1b.json

    native/
      json/
        (authoritative, machine-readable governance artifacts)

    non_native/
      json/
        (expanded or interpretive matrices)

    norms/
      eu_ai_act/
        annex_vii/
          (EU AI Act alignment checklists and mappings)
      iso/
        (future ISO alignment notes)

    exec_ops/
      board/
      operator/
      regulator/

4. Native vs non-native artifacts
4.1 Native governance artifacts (authoritative)

Artifacts in native/ are:

machine-readable

schema-validated

scope-bound and time-bound

the single source of truth for governance state and assurance

If a discrepancy exists between artifacts, native artifacts always take precedence.

Native artifacts are suitable for:

automated tooling

regulator ingestion

assurance validation

cross-system interoperability

4.2 Non-native artifacts (interpretive)

Expanded Annex VII mapping files are provided under non_native/json/ for review convenience.

Artifacts in non_native/ are:

expanded, human-readable, or review-oriented

provided to aid understanding, readiness, and discussion

never authoritative

They must not be presented as governance evidence or used to substitute missing native artifacts.

5. Norm-specific alignment folders

The norms/ directory groups artifacts by regulatory or standards language, not by authority.

Examples include:

EU AI Act Annex VII readiness checklists

future ISO/IEC 42001 or ISO/IEC 27001 alignment notes

Norm folders:

do not redefine governance

do not introduce new requirements

exist to support proportional, regulator-friendly interpretation

Canonical governance artifacts always remain in native/.

6. Executive and operational guidance

The exec_ops/ directory contains human-facing guidance for:

boards and risk committees

operators and governance leads

regulators and standards reviewers

These documents explain how to engage, how to interpret, and how to communicate — but they do not represent governance state.

They are explicitly informative and non-normative.

7. Manifests and integrity

Each extension release includes its own manifest (e.g. manifest_v1b.json) that:

enumerates included artifacts

records hashes and metadata

establishes review integrity

Manifests are extension-scoped and do not modify or replace the root manifest.

8. Relationship to other versions

Version A (root of repository)
Defines the authoritative, model-agnostic governance framework.
The stable Version A Public Review Draft is available at: https://policyofdevelopments.org/whitepaper/vol2-a-web-of-sharing-trust-responsibility-toward-a-trustless-future

Version B (this folder)
Demonstrates execution-level feasibility using a reference architecture.

Version C (future)
Will address onboarding and operational mechanics without redefining governance authority.

Each version is reviewed independently and does not retroactively alter prior versions.

9. Canonical source

The canonical public review distribution for Version B artifacts is published via GitHub releases under:

_future_extensions/v1b/

Only artifacts listed in the corresponding manifest should be considered part of the official v1b release.

10. Disclaimer

Artifacts in this folder:

do not certify systems

do not assert regulatory compliance

do not replace legal or sector-specific obligations

must not be used to claim approval or authorization

They are provided to support transparent, evidence-based discussion of runtime AI governance.

This README intentionally mirrors the structure and tone of the root README while making the extension boundary explicit. It is suitable for standards bodies, regulators, and open-source reviewers.
